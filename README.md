# SfM_WithMissingData
Structure from motion project with missing data implementing Jacobs’ approximation for missing data in the structure from motion algorithm outlined in his paper “Linear Fitting With Missing Data For Structure From Motion*” (2001).


### How to Run

- Download with git
- Open directory in matlab
- Run main.m in matlab
- Customise noise_std in main.m to adjust noise
- Customize removeDataNum in main.m to remove datapoints
- (to use middlebury dataset, you must be on the grinnell server, middlebury data is storred in Weinmans direcotry)
